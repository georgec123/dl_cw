## Files
- `src/eda.ipynb` - We perform some exploratory data analysis to understand the data we are working with. We develop ideas of features to engineer, and we look at the feature importance by training a Random Forest.
- `src/parameter_tune.ipynb` - We fit and cross validate our Neural Network, and find optimal hyperparameters.
- `train_and_predict.ipynb` - Using the tuned hyperparameters, we train a final model on the whole training data and use this to predict the labels of the testing data.
